JOB MATRIX – AI Job Portal

Project Overview:
JOB MATRIX is a web-based AI Job Portal designed to simplify and enhance the job search and hiring experience. The platform focuses on providing a clean, user-friendly interface along with intelligent features that help users explore job opportunities, learn about hiring companies, and interact with an AI-powered chatbot for basic guidance.
This project holds special importance as it was my first trial project and first major capstone project during my First Year (FY) of Engineering. It represents my early hands-on experience with real-world project development, where I moved from learning concepts to building a complete application.
The project was initially developed as a prototype. During the capstone phase, frontend and backend responsibilities were divided among team members. While I completed the entire frontend, the backend could not be finalized within the given academic timeline. After submitting the capstone, I independently developed the backend, and the final frontend–backend integration (merging) remains as the pending step.

Objectives of the Project:
To build a structured job portal using core web technologies
To gain real-world experience through a first trial project
To understand team-based project development and workflows
To design interactive and user-friendly UI components
To explore AI-assisted user interaction through a chatbot

Features Implemented:

Responsive homepage layout
Navigation bar with multiple sections (Home, Jobs, Post Job, Register)
Sidebar-based user panel
Hiring companies showcase section

AI features overview section:
Interactive chatbot positioned at the bottom-right
Chatbot with predefined intelligent responses

Technology Stack:
Frontend (Completed)
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
The complete frontend was designed and developed by me, including layout design, responsiveness, UI interactions, and client-side chatbot logic. The frontend was structured to support future backend integration.

Backend (Developed Separately):
Backend development was initially assigned to a team member during the capstone phase, but it could not be completed due to time constraints.
Later, I independently developed the backend as a separate module to strengthen the project’s functionality.
The final integration of frontend and backend is planned as the next step.
This process helped me understand independent backend development as well as the real-world challenges involved in merging different system components.

Team Collaboration:
This project was developed as a team-based capstone project. My responsibilities included:
Complete frontend development
UI/UX design and styling
Client-side chatbot logic
Overall layout and interaction handling
Backend development was initially assigned to a teammate, which helped me understand role distribution and collaborative workflows. Developing the backend later on my own further strengthened my full-stack understanding.

Learning Outcomes:
Built my first complete web-based application
Strengthened frontend development skills
Gained exposure to backend development independently
Understood frontend–backend separation and integration challenges
Learned real-world project planning and execution
Developed confidence to take ownership of incomplete modules

Future Scope:
Final frontend–backend integration
Authentication and authorization system
Database integration for jobs and user profiles
AI-driven job recommendations
Resume analysis and enhanced chatbot using NLP

Conclusion

JOB MATRIX represents my first practical step into web application development. As a first-year trial and capstone project, it reflects my growth, adaptability, and willingness to go beyond assigned responsibilities. Although final integration is pending, the project now has both frontend and backend components developed, providing a solid foundation for future expansion.
