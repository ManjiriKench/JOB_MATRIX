# JOB_MATRIX
Our AI-powered job portal intelligently recommends suitable job roles by analyzing user resumes using Tesseract OCR and extracting key skills through NLP techniques. 
The system uses Sentence-BERT to convert skills into semantic embeddings, and a Nearest Neighbors model (with cosine similarity) to find the closest matching job profiles from a curated dataset. 
Skill gap analysis helps users identify missing competencies, while a Gemini-powered chatbot assists with queries. 
Technologies used include Python, Flask (backend), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend), Tesseract OCR, Sentence-BERT, Scikit-learn, and Joblib for model persistence. 

*Currently, the frontend and backend are developed separately and not yet integrated.*
